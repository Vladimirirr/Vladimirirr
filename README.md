## Hi there 👋

I am a Frontend software engineer, who also know Backend a little.

My name is Zhenyu Yang, and my nickname are `/RYZZ(Z)*/` and `/Vladimir(irr)?/`, which both are my favourite characters in LOL.

There are some my favorite technologies:

- Languages: JavaScript and C (🍉 for wasm)
- Frameworks: Vue and React (🥦 the concurrent with fiber is so amazing)
- Utilities: Lodash and Ramda (🥩 functional programming)

Now, I am studying MSE technology in browsers.

Last but not least, my favorite sentence is "你在雨中行走，你从不打伞，你有你自己的天空，它从不下雨。".
